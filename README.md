# LEARN GFX 2D

This project consists of a series of examples meant to help me learn as well as teach how to use [GFX](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx) for 2d graphics, primarily aimed at making 2d games.

The examples can be ran using `cargo run --example $EXAMPLE_NAME`

As I progress through examples I will add tutorials both in the READMEs of the various examples, as well as at [my blog](http://jamiltron.com).

If there are any mistakes or better ways of writing or explaining these examples please let me know.

Thank you for looking!
